# ppmm

The ppmm package implements the proxy pattern-mixture model (PPMM) for means, proportions, and linear regression coefficients as described in:

(means) Andridge RR, Little RJA (2011). Proxy pattern-mixture analysis for survey nonresponse. Journal of Official Statistics, 27; 153-180.

(proportions) Andridge RR, Little RJA. (2020) Proxy pattern-mixture analysis for a binary variable subject to nonresponse. Journal of Official Statistics, 36; 703-728.

(regression coefficients) West BT, Little RJ, Andridge RR, Boonstra P, Ware EB, Pandit A, Alvarado-Leiton F (2021). Assessing selection bias in regression coefficients estimated from nonprobability samples with applications to genetics and demographic surveys. Annals of Applied Statistics, 15; 1556-1581.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ppmm from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install package `ppmm`
devtools::install_github("randridge/ppmm")
library(ppmm)
```

## Example

NEEDS MODIFYING

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ppmm)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
